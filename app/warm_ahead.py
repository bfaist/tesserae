"""Warm-ahead: a page's widgets run before a scheduled send, so slow work
(an AI painting in flight, say) is finished when the real render happens
and the panel paints the finished page once.

A widget opts in through its manifest::

    "render": {"warm_ahead_s": 150}

That number is only the first guess. Each warm polls the page until it stops
asking for a refresh (the ``live_refresh_s`` hint, see ``composer.refresh_hint_s``)
and learns from it: how many pieces of work the page said were pending at the
start (``live_pending``) against how long it took to settle gives seconds per
item; a page that says nothing about pending work is learned as a whole. The
next lead is the typical number of items for that page times the seconds per
item, plus the page's own base time, with a margin, so a page that paints
three aircraft at fifteen seconds each is warmed about a minute ahead and one
that paints ten gets three. A warm that runs out of lead before the page
settles asks for more next time.
